# README.emde

If you were to make a poetic expression, like a stream of consciousness about me, from me, something that expresses me in a README but without saying it, not specific things but the flow and the thought process and the expression and if it made a story and a narrative and a trail along a path through a forest about the way and the things and the [not found] of me so I can show the code and the words and put it here like a weird little intro that no one will read but if they do they will think huh why did he just put the prompt here instead of the output of the prompt?
